abstract = {In order to use the words "big" and little" appropriately, adults use 3 kinds of contexts: normative (the size of the object is compared to a stored mental representation), perceptual (the object is compared to another physically present object of the same kind), and functional (the object is judged with regard to its intended use). In 3 experiments, we examined how flexibly children switch from one context to another. 2-4-year-olds judged a series of everyday objects as "big" or "little". To answer correctly, children had to judge each object twice, once in a normative context and once in a perceptual or functional context. Results showed that switching from one context to another was not inherently difficult, even for 2-year-olds. However, the direction of switch was important: children throughout the age range tested switched easily from a normative context but made errors when asked to switch to a normative context. We suggest that the normative context differs from the perceptual and functional contexts in that it is unmarked, and that unmarked contexts are accessible only when no other context has been recently experienced. When context is marked more explicitly, children shift flexibly among different meanings.},

abstract = {Generalizations about categories are central to human understanding, and generic language (e.g. "Dogs bark.") provides a simple and ubiquitous way to communicate these generalizations. Yet the meaning of generic language is philosophically puzzling and has resisted precise formalization. We explore the idea that the core meaning of a generic sentence is simple but underspecified, and that general principles of pragmatic reasoning are responsible for establishing the precise meaning in context. Building on recent probabilistic models of language understanding, we provide a formal model for the evaluation and comprehension of generic sentences. This model explains the puzzling flexibility in usage of generics in terms of diverse prior beliefs about properties. We elicit these priors experimentally and show that the resulting model predictions explain almost all of the variance in human judgments for both common and novel generics. We probe the theory in more detail, and find that generic language depends in a fundamental way on subjective beliefs, not mere frequency. This theory provides the mathematical bridge between the words we use and the concepts they describe.},

abstract = {The meaning of gradable adjectives is highly context-dependent, and is notoriously difficult to capture precisely. Re-cent work in theoretical linguistics suggests that the way we use gradable adjectives can be explained in terms of optimal language use. To test this hypothesis we formulate a prob-abilistic speaker model that combines ideas from Bayesian approaches to pragmatic reasoning as social cognition with broader optimality considerations, as suggested by evolution-ary linguistics. We demonstrate that, despite its simplicity, the model explains empirical data on the applicability of adjectives in context astonishingly well.},

abstract = {Semantic theories differ in the role they assume for degrees in the inter-pretation of gradable adjectives, and in the assumptions they make about the nature of degrees and the structure of the scales they comprise. We report on two experi-ments investigating speakers' use of gradable adjectives across varying contexts, with the goal of gaining insight into the nature of the degree ontology underlying their semantics. We find that the truth conditions for the positive form must be stated in terms of degrees rather than rankings of individuals, and further that the relevant scale structure is one where distances between scale points are meaningful, and not an ordinal scale derived from an ordering relation on a comparison class. We also find no evidence that scale structure depends on the presence or absence of a corresponding system of numerical measures.},

abstract = {This paper addresses two issues that arise in a degree-based approach to the semantics of positive forms of gradable adjectives such as tall in the sentence John is tall (e.g., Kennedy {\&} McNally 2005; Kennedy 2007): First, how the standard of comparison is contextually determined; Second, why gradable adjectives exhibit the relative-absolute distinction. Combining ideas of previous evolutionary and probabilistic approaches (e.g., Potts 2008; Franke 2012; Lassiter 2011; Lassiter {\&} Goodman 2013), we propose a new model that makes exact and empirically testable probabilistic predictions about speakers' use of gradable adjectives and that derives the relative-absolute distinction from considerations of optimal language use. Along the way, we distinguish between vagueness and loose use, and argue that, within our approach, vagueness can be understood as the result of uncertainty about the exact degree distribution within the comparison class.},

@article{Bale2011,
abstract = {This paper evaluates three accounts of comparison classes – sets that rel-ativize the interpretation of gradable adjectives, often specified with for -clauses as in John is smart for a linguist. The first proposes that such classes serve as an argument to a function that determines a standard of comparison. The second maintains that these classes restrict the domain of a measure function used to map entities to degrees. The third proposes that these classes limit the kind of individuals that participate in a binary relation. This relation is then used in the construction of a scale and a measure function. It is this third account that is most consistent with the empirical data. It can explain how comparison classes fix a standard of comparison, induce presuppositions concerning the comparative subjects, and induce incommensurability in comparative constructions. This empirical result for comparison classes is significant since it sug-gests that scales in the semantic system are built from and dependent on more basic relations between individuals.},

abstract = {Certain uses of vague quantifiers few and many intuitively compare a true quantity to a priori expectations about that quantity. A concrete proposal for the truth conditions of such readings stipu-lates a contextually-stable threshold on a contextually-variable representation of a priori expectations (Clark 1991, Fernando and Kamp 1996). The main goal of this paper is to introduce data-driven com-putational modeling as a means to implement and test complex semantic theories of this kind, which may be hard to assess based on solitary introspection of meaning intuitions. Based on an empirical measure of a priori expectations, we use Bayesian inference to estimate likely values of the latent threshold parameters given empirical data from production and comprehension tasks. We demon-strate how posterior inference and statistical model comparison can help assess the plausibility of the fixed threshold hypothesis.},

abstract = {This paper investigates the role of comparison classes in the semantics of gradable adjectives in the positive form, focusing on the case where the comparison class is expressed overtly via a for -phrase (e.g. John is tall for a jockey). Two central questions are addressed: what in-formation does the comparison class provide, and how is this information integrated compositionally? It is shown that the standard of comparison invoked by the positive form can be analyzed as a range of values whose width is based on the degree of dispersion in the comparison class. Com-positionally, the comparison class can be analyzed as an argument of a null positive morpheme (contra Kennedy [13]), in parallel to recent pro-posals for the superlative (e.g. Heim [9]). The implications of the analysis for the choice between degree-and delineation-based analyses of gradable adjectives are discussed.},

@article{Lassiter2013,
abstract = {Relative adjectives in the positive form exhibit vagueness and contextsensitivity. We suggest that these phenomena can be explained by the interaction of a free threshold variable in the meaning of the positive form with a probabilistic model of pragmatic inference. We describe a formal model of utterance interpretation as coordination, which jointly infers the value of the threshold variable and the intended meaning of the sentence. We report simulations exploring the effect of background statistical knowledge on adjective interpretation in this model. Motivated by these simulation results, we suggest that this approach can account for the correlation between scale structure and the relative/absolute distinction while also allowing for exceptions noted in previous work. Finally, we argue for a probabilistic explanation of why the sorites paradox is compelling with relative adjectives even though the second premise is false on a universal interpretation, and show that this account predicts Kennedy's (2007) observation that the sorites paradox is more compelling with relative than with absolute adjectives.},

@article{Goodman2016,
abstract = {Understanding language is more than the use of fixed conventions and more than decoding combinatorial structure. Instead, comprehenders make exquisitely sensitive inferences about what utterances mean given their knowledge of the speaker, the language, and the context. Building on developments in game theory and probabilistic modeling, we describe the rational speech act (RSA) framework for pragmatic reasoning. RSA models provide a principled way to formalize inferences about meaning in context; they have been used to make successful quantitative predictions about human behavior in a wide variety of different tasks and situations, and they explain why complex phenomena like hyperbole and vagueness occur. More generally, they provide a computational framework for integrating linguistic structure, world knowledge, and context in pragmatic language understanding.},

@article{Kennedy2007,
abstract = {This paper investigates the way that lexical semantic properties of linguistic expressions influence vagueness, focusing on the interpretation of the positive (un-marked) form of gradable adjectives. I begin by developing a semantic analysis of the positive form of 'relative' gradable adjectives, expanding on previous proposals by further motivating a semantic basis for vagueness and by precisely identifying and characterizing the division of labor between the compositional and contextual aspects of its interpretation. I then introduce a challenge to the analysis from the class of 'absolute' gradable adjectives: adjectives that are demonstrably gradable, but which have positive forms that relate objects to maximal or minimal degrees, and do not give rise to vagueness. I argue that the truth conditional difference between relative and absolute adjectives in the positive form stems from the interaction of lexical semantic properties of gradable adjectives—the structure of the scales they use—and a general constraint on interpretive economy that requires truth conditions to be computed on and the Zentrum f{\"{u}} r allgemeine Sprachwissenschaft, Berlin, for very helpful comments and feedback on earlier versions of this work.
